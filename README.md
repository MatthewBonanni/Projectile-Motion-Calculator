# Projectile-Motion-Calculator
This software simulates projectile motion with optional parameters for air resistance, using viscous and Newtonian drag models. Uses the Runge-Kutta method to solve ordinary differential equations of motion for projectile flight trajectories. Plots trajectories and returns data of interest. Provides options for direct user GUI input or multiple parameter input by .csv file.

Note: Projectiles are assumed to be spherical.
